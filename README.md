# cashu-rs
cashu-rs is a Chaumian Ecash library written in Rust.

Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on David Wagner's variant of Chaumian blinding. Token logic based
on [minicash](https://github.com/phyro/minicash) ([description](https://gist.github.com/phyro/935badc682057f418842c72961cf096c))
which implements a [Blind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) scheme
written down by Ruben Somsen [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406). 
Please read the [Cashu](https://github.com/callebtc/cashu) documentation for more detailed information.

This project aims to replicate the python mint implementation of cashu.
